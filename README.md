Homeworks were done in Python, and utilized OpenCV libraries. 

# Homework 1

Image Processing : Worked with Gaussian filter, Median filter, Seperable filters, Difference of Gaussian, Histogram Equalization and Low/High pass filters.

# Homework 2

Generated SIFT features for scene matching and stitching, and HoG features for object recognition.

# Homework 3

Estimated depth with stereo, did image classification using Bag of SIFT representation + SVM classifier.

# Homework 4

Designed and trained deep convolutional networks for scene recognition using PyTorch. 

# Homework 5

Part 1 : Rendered images using Ray casting and the Blinn-Phong model.

Part 2 : Worked on object detection with Faster-RCNN.
